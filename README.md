### 1. Infinite-Scroll Challenge

## Description
Implemented an infinite scroll feature based on a given static dataset of Pinterest Pins. This implementation was done in a modular way so that the rendering of Pins
could be easily reused in other pages and this page could be given other widgets to arrange on the page and support infinite scrolling.
